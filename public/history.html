<h1>Dive into the Black Swordman's History</h1>
<p>Guts was born from the corpse of his hanged mother beneath a tree, 
left to die alone in a mire of blood and afterbirth. 
A mercenary group led by a man named Gambino eventually happened upon the site, 
presuming the infant to be dead. When the baby began wailing, 
to the mercenaries' surprise, an acquaintance of Gambino's, Shisu, 
immediately took to the child and came to his aid. 
Gambino allowed the woman to keep Guts for her own personal consolation, 
despite his cohorts considering the circumstances of Guts' birth ominous. 
Three years later, Guts' surrogate mother contracted the plague and died as he watched on.</p>
